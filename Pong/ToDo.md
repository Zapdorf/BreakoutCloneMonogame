## Bugs
- double block hit bug
- odd upward bounce when hitting multiple
- ball will travel upward if hit straight up along block edge
- Particle system stutters and the particles flash (timer and draw might be broken)

---

## Jank
- no shared game object class
- Game manager is unused


could try to add a position based bounce system
i.e if collision and left of left side of sprite
